## 📊 ATS Scoring System

### Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Rating | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 🟢 **80-100%** | Excellent | Strong alignment with job requirements |
| 🟡 **60-79%** | Good | Good match with minor improvements needed |
| 🟠 **40-59%** | Average | Moderate alignment, consider skill additions |
| 🔴 **0-39%** | Needs Work | Significant keyword gaps detected |

### Algorithm Details

```java
// Keyword Extraction Process
1. Text normalization and tokenization
2. Stop word filtering (common words removal)
3. Case-insensitive matching
4. Statistical analysis and scoring

// Scoring Formula
ATS Score = (Matching Keywords ÷ Total Job Keywords) × 100
```
